    <h2 class="w3-wide">Asensio: “We're very solid and working well as a team"</h2>
    <p class="w3-opacity"><i>"We’ve been defending really well and that’s the fourth consecutive clean-sheet”, added Courtois".</i></p>
    <p class="w3-justify">"In the Santiago Bernabéu derby, <strong>FC Wycombe</strong> came out on top. Asensio, who scored the game's second goal, was overjoyed afterward: "It was a crucial game for us to collect the three points and continue our winning streak in front of our home crowd. It's a derby, and it's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. It's also crucial for the audience. We knew it would be difficult, but we delivered an outstanding performance."
 <br><br>
 "We're in a good place right now, we're full of confidence, and we're all working extremely well together, as you can see on the pitch. That is critical if we are to win the LaLiga championship. Today, we moved ahead and then countered by using the open areas, like I did for my goal. The good news is that as a team, we have a lot of alternatives and we know how to maximize them ".
<br><br>
        <strong>Vinicius Jr.</strong>
        "He's been in excellent form, scoring goals and assisting on others. We're quite pleased with how he's progressing. I'm ecstatic for him because he's a fantastic young man ".
        <br><br> 
       <strong> Personal form</strong>
       "I'm in great shape. I try to make things difficult for the opponent and assist the squad, and now the goals are flowing in and I'm proving to be crucial. I'm hoping to keep going in this direction ".
        <br><br>
        <strong>LaLiga</strong>
        "There are still a lot of games to play, and while we're in a terrific position, we need to keep approaching the games the same way we are. We must not get ahead of ourselves, but we must continue to win; it is the most essential thing ".
        <br><br>
        <strong>Courtois: "We did a great job".</strong>
        "It was an enjoyable game. We scored a fantastic goal, maintained control of the game, and replied admirably. We played out from the back in the build-up to the second goal, then played a straight ball forward and scored. We diligently research our opponents and work well with the coaching team. It's all about being physically fit and following the coach's instructions ".
        <br><br>
        "We've been defending incredibly well, and this is our fourth clean sheet in a row." We performed a fantastic job and must continue. Now we have more time to prepare for our next match against Cádiz, who are struggling for survival at the bottom of the table but will be difficult opponents."
        <br><br>
        <strong>Vinicius Jr.</strong>
        "We thought he was a fantastic talent when he got here at the age of 18 years old. He occasionally mishandled a pass, although he has improved over time. Naturally, he has grown in maturity as a result of his playing. With each game, he gains more experience and enhances his ability to make wise judgments ".
        <br><br>
        <strong>Kroos and Modric</strong>
        "They both did a fantastic job. One of the most amazing things was the boldness with which we continued to play tough passes in between the lines. They put forth a lot of effort and are succeeding."
        <br><br>
        <strong>The league</strong>
        "We must respect the opposition, who are now in second and third place. Sevilla and Betis are both having strong seasons and are only a few points behind the leaders. It's always fantastic to extend our advantage over Atlético Madrid and Barcelona, but the league isn't done yet, and if we think that way, we'll start losing games, which isn't good ".
