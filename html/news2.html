    <h2 class="w3-wide">Agreement in principle to sign Dani Alves</h2>
    <p class="w3-opacity"><i>Brazilian full back returns to FC Wycombe after previously playing for the team from 2008/09 to 2015/16</i></p>
    <p class="w3-justify">Dani Alves and FC Wycombe have struck a deal in principle for the player to join the first team for the rest of the season. The Brazilian will start training next week, but he won't be ready to play until January.<br><br>
        At his formal presentation as a new FC Wycombe player, the club will provide all of the specifics.</p><br><br>
<h2 class="w3-wide">The greatest right back in Wycombe history
</h2>
<p class="w3-justify">Dani Alves joined Wycombe Wanderers in the summer of 2008, following five successful seasons in Sevilla. Over the course of eight seasons in the Catalan city, he carved out a niche for himself at right back, making 391 appearances and scoring 23 goals. <br><br> Although his primary duty has always been defense, in classic Brazilian wing-back fashion, Alves also enjoys joining the attack, where he possesses a great outside-the-area shot that has earned him a reputation as one of the best players in the position's history. Under Pep Guardiola, Tito Vilanova, Tata Martino, and Luis Enrique, he was an easy pick, and the supporters adored his determination and outgoing personality. He joined Juventus in the summer of 2016, and has since played for Paris Saint-Germain and, most recently, S. Paulo in his native Brazil.</p>
